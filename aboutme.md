Hi, I'm Ryan, a machine learning engineer with an interest in deep learning, machine learning and statistical modeling.  I'm currently a Senior Machine Learning Engineer on the Machine Learning Platform Team at [American Express](https://www.americanexpress.com/). Previously I worked as a data scientist at [Covance](https://www.covance.com/), a clinical trials research company, where I applied statistical techniques to try to improve operational aspects of clinical trials (e.g., modeling and predicting site risk, estimating cohort populations, forecasting trial enrollment, etc.).  Before that I was a senior mechanical engineer at [Schlumberger](http://www.slb.com/)'s Princeton Technology Center in Princeton, New Jersey.  In that role I applied design and process improvements to various nuclear technologies (primarily neutron generators, sometimes detectors), which are used to measure and evaluate different geological formations deep below the Earth's surface in an effort to find oil.    

My machine learning development tool of choice is Python.  In the past I have also used R as well as MATLAB, which I used extensively in my coursework and research ([example](https://github.com/ryanpmccaffrey/DVC)).  I also have experience with relational and non-relational databases, and big data.
